Description: We provides functions that employ penalized spline (P-spline) to estimate generalized 
             partially linear single index models (GPLSIM), which extend the generalized linear 
             models to include nonlinear effect for some predictors. Please see Y. (2017) at
             <doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9639-0> and Y., and R. (2002) at <doi:10.1198/016214502388618861> for more details.
