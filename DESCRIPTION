Description: We provides functions that employ splines to estimate generalized 
             partially linear single index models (GPLSIM), which extend the generalized linear 
             models to include nonlinear effect for some predictors. Please see Y. (2017) at
             <doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9639-0> and Y., and R. (2002) at <doi:10.1198/016214502388618861> for more details.
